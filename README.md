# When you want to train anothor time the AI Model you have 2 options:
1 - Execute the model using your CPU you must Download The following libraries: 
      - pytorch library using pip command (pip install torch)
      - facenet-pytorch library using pip command (pip install facenet-pytorch)
      - opencv library using pip command (pip install opencv-python)
2 - Execute the model using your GPU you must follow the Documentation of pytorch(https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
